  title: What We’ve Learned From Billions of Security Reports
  abstract: |
    Running one of the largest security reporting platforms of its kind, we handle billions of security reports for our customers every single month. Come and learn how we've scaled from handling 10,000 reports per month to 10,000 reports per second and the many evolutions our infrastructure has gone through.
    Alongside that come and see how, with our bird’s-eye view of such a diverse ecosystem, we’ve helped identify malware in a multinational organisation, had a malicious browser plugin taken down and much more!

  title: Building an agile Security Organization
  abstract: |
    In 2017, Vipps was carved out from DNB. It is now owned by multiple banks, and Vipps has had to re-engineer its approach to Security Governance.  
    PwC had been contracted by Vipps in Winter 2017 to build an agile Information Security Management System (ISMS). Additionally, PwC was engaged to help with the implementation of metrics & security monitoring within the organization, handling security incident operations and assisting Vipps with ISMS and Security Governance following the merger. 
    In this talk, we'll go through the business case of how we built agile ISMS, how PwC intends to support Vipps' ISMS and Security Architecture, and how this could transform the way Vipps is seen and experienced by its customers.

  title: The State of Your Supply Chain
  abstract: |
    Container security often focuses on runtime best-practices whilst neglecting delivery of the software in the supply chain. Application, library, and OS vulnerabilities are a likely route to data exfiltration, and emerging technologies in the container ecosystem offer a new opportunity to mitigate this risk. 
    Treating containers as immutable artefacts and injecting configuration allows us to "upgrade" images by rebuilding and shipping whole software bundles, avoiding configuration drift and state inconsistencies. This makes it possible to constantly patch software, and to easily enforce governance of artefacts both pre- and post-deployment.
    In this talk we detail an ideal, security-hardened container supply chain, describe the current state of the ecosystem, and dig into specific tools. Grafeas, Kritis, in-toto, Clair, Micro Scanner, TUF, and Notary are covered, and we demo how to gate container image pipelines and deployments on cryptographically verified supply chain metadata.

  title: Machine Learning for Security
  abstract: |
    The ability to mathematically classify patterns, predict events and/or identify abnormalities within a wide range of data is known as Machine Learning. For the purpose of this conference , we explain the power of data and how it can be used with Machine Learning models to identify abnormal behaviour within complex environments. We also explain the ingredients and the steps required to build a Machine Learning models to serve security tasks. This will further be followed by its complications in terms of false positives, accuracy of detection and validity of model and how this can be improved.

She is also involved in the Include C++ organization hoping to improve diversity and inclusion in the C++ community.
  title: Linux Security APIs and the Chromium Sandbox
  abstract: |
    The Linux Security and Isolation APIs have become the basis of some of the most useful features server-side, providing the isolation required for efficient containers. However, these APIs also form the basis of the Chromium Sandbox on Linux, and we will study them in that context in this talk.
